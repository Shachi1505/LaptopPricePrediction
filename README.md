By Shachi Singhal

Regression Model
Objective is to forecast a numeric value (price), laptop price prediction is classified as a regression task. The output of the model would be a continuous value representing the predicted price. We will calculate R^2 score. RÂ² Score is used for regression problems and measures how well the model explains the variability in the target variable. Note: Accuracy is calculated for classification problems, like disease prediction, email smap etc.
